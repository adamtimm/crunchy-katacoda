This exercise shows you the steps to add pg_tileserv to your PostGIS implementation. 

First, take a look at the tab in the terminal to the right called "pg_tileserv". You'll see that it's still waiting for an available conneciton on port 7800, the port that pg_tileserv serves data on. That's because we haven't added pg_tileserv to our PostGIS implementation yet. Let's do that now.

## Add pg_tileserv

To add pg_tileserv to your PostGIS database, you need to either download the [source code](https://github.com/CrunchyData/pg_tileserv), the binaries, or one of our supported containers. We'll use the container version of pg_tileserv for this scenario. 

The code block below allows you to click on it to have the code execute in the terminal. Be sure to click on the ```Terminal``` tab before click on the box to make sure the code executes in the correct tab. You also have the option of copying and pasting the code, or typing it yourself in the ```Terminal``` tab.

```docker run -p 5000:5000 timmam/spatialwebdemo:latest```{{execute}}

You'll see that the connection info we provided in the intro (database name: `firedata`, username: `groot`, and password: `password`) is used in the statement above. 

You should see lines of output like this in the terminal:

```sh
time="2020-07-02T14:06:45Z" level=info msg="pg_tileserv CI"
time="2020-07-02T14:06:45Z" level=info msg="Run with --help parameter for commandline options"
time="2020-07-02T14:06:45Z" level=info msg="Using database connection info from environment variable DATABASE_URL"
time="2020-07-02T14:06:45Z" level=info msg="Serving HTTP  at 0.0.0.0:7800"
time="2020-07-02T14:06:45Z" level=info msg="Serving HTTPS at 0.0.0.0:7801"
time="2020-07-02T14:06:45Z" level=info msg="Connected as 'groot' to 'nyc' @ '172.18.0.2'"
time="2020-07-02T14:06:47Z" level=info msg="HEAD /" method=HEAD url=/
time="2020-07-02T14:06:50Z" level=info msg="GET /" method=GET url=/
```

Now, if you look at the pg_tileserv tab again, you'll see the default UI as well as all of the Santa Cruz County GIS data being delivered as features (under ```Table Layers```).

Next, we'll add pg_tileserv to the database to be able to add vector tiles to our app.
